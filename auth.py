"""
Company access: no human-facing email, password, or Google login at all —
just a 4-digit access code per organization.

HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS UNDER THE HOOD:
Supabase's Row Level Security (used to keep each company's candidates/jobs/
interviews private from every other company) is keyed off auth.uid(), which
only exists for a real, logged-in Supabase Auth session. So the app still
needs *some* real account per company to satisfy that — it's just entirely
hidden from the person using the app.

At creation time, each company gets ONE auto-generated, random Supabase
Auth account (a fake internal email + a long random password, neither of
which any human ever sees or types). Those hidden credentials are stored
alongside the company row. When someone enters the correct 4-digit access
code for that company, the app looks up those hidden credentials (only
if the code matches — see get_company_login in migration_companies.sql)
and logs in with them automatically. The access code is the only thing a
human ever needs to know or share.

CREATE FLOW:
  create_company(name, ...) -> generates hidden credentials, creates the
  Supabase Auth account, creates the companies row (with a random 4-digit
  access_code), logs the creator in immediately. Returns the access code
  to show once on screen.

ENTER FLOW (returning users, via the Choose Company picker):
  enter_company_with_code(company_id, code) -> looks up the hidden
  credentials via the get_company_login() database function (which only
  returns them if the code matches), logs in with them, done.

REQUIRED SUPABASE SETUP: run migration_companies.sql. No email-related
dashboard settings are needed at all — this app never sends or requires
any confirmation email for auth purposes.
